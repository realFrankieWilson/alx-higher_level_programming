#### Tasks:
#### 0. Simple rectangle

	Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
		You are not allowed to import any module

#### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
	Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
		Private instance attribute: width:
			property def width(self): to retrieve it:
				width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
				If width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
		Private instance attribute: height:
			property def height(self): to retrieve it
			property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
				height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
				If height is less than 0, raise ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
		Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
		You are not allowed to import any module
