#### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

Write a program that imports the function *def add(a, b):* from the file *add_0.py* and the result of the addition *1 + 2 = 3*

	* You have to use *print* function with string format to display integers
	* Assign:
		The value 1 to a variable called a
		The value 2 to a variable called b
		and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print.
	* *a* and *b* must be defined in 2 different lines: *a* *=* *1* and another *b* = *2*
	* The program should print: a value + b value = add(a, b) value followed with a new line

	* The code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__
