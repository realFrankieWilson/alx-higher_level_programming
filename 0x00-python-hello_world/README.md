## 0x00. Python - Hello, World

#### Zen
The zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass slently.
Unless explicity silenced.
In the face of abiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespace are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!


## TASKS:

#### 0. Run Python file
* Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
* The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

#### 1. Run inline
* Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
* The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

#### 2. Hello, print
* Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
* The use of print function is allowed.

#### 3. Print integer
This challenge is about completing a [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py), in order to print integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery Street, followed by a new line.

* The expected output of the code:
	* The number, followed by Batterey street,
	* followed by a new line
* variable is not allowed to cast number into a sttring.
* Code must be 3 lines long
* f-strings is to be used.

#### 4. Print float
Complete the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.
* The output of the program should be:
	* Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits.
	* followed by a new line.
* casting number variable to a string is not allowed.
* use f-string.

#### 5. Print string
Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.
* The output of the program should be:
	* 3 times the value of str
	* followed by a new line
	* followed by the 9 first characters of str
	* followed by a new line
* No loops or conditional statement is allowed
* Program should be a maximum of 5 lines long.

#### 6. Play with strings
Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print **welcome to Holberton School!**
* loops or conditional statements are not allowed.
* variable str1 and str2 must be used in the new line of code.
* The program should be exactly 5 lines long.

#### 7. Copy- Cut- Paste
Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)
* Loops or conditional statements are not allowed.
* The program should be exactly 8 lines long
* *word_first_3* should contain the first 3 letters of the variable *word*
* *word_last_2* should contain the last 2 letters of the variable *word*
* *middle_word* should contain the value of the variable *word* without the first and last letters

#### 8. Create a new sentence
Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) to print object-oriented programming with Python. Followed by a new line.
* Loops or conditional statements are not allowed.
* The program should be exactly 5 lines long.
* Creating a new variable is not allowed.
* Using of string literals (values)
