#### *TASKS:*

#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
	Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number
	 is positive or negative
* [The souce code](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/e4tR3cjFHqhelf4y485-zQ)
* The variable *number* will store a different value every time the program is run

The expected output:

	* The number, follwed by 
	* if the number is greater than 0: *is positive*
	* if the number is 0 *is zero*
	* if the number is less thatn 0: *is negative*
	* followed by a new line.


#### 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable *number* each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable *number*
	* sourc code [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Vku0ZPFeDPuXUKD8nZ4mOQ).

	* The output of this program should be:
	* The number, followed by 
	* The string *is*, followed by the last digit of *number*, followed by 
	*	if the last digit is greater than 5: the string *and is greater than 5*
	*	if the last digit is 0: the string *and is 0*
	*	if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string *and is less than 6 and not 0*
	* followed by a new line.


#### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when i can't fall asleep, I play what i call the alphabet game.
Wriet a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

	* The use of print function can only be used with string format.
	* Only one loop is allowed in this code
	* Storing characters in a variable is not allowed.
	* Importation of any module is not allowed.


#### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off.
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

	* Print all the letters except q and e
	* only one print function with a string format is allowed
	* Only one loop is allowed
	* Using of variables is not allowed.
	* No importation of any module.


#### 4. Hexadecimal printing
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

	* print function is allowed only once with string format.
	* only one loop is allowed.
	* storing numbers in variable is not allowed
	* importation of module is not allowed.


#### 5. 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

	* Numbers must be separated by *,*, followed by a space
	* Numbers should be printed in asccending order, with two digits.
	* The last number should be followed by a new line.
	* No more than 2 print function with string format
	* Only one loop is allowed.
	* variable usage to store numbers is not allowed.
	* Module importation is not allowed.


#### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need.
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

	* Numbers must be separated by *,* followed by a space
	* The two digits must be different
	* *01* and *10* are considered the same combination of the two digits *0* and *1*
	* Print only the smallest combination of two digits
	* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
	* The last number should be followed by a new line
	* No more than 3 function are allowed
	* No more than 2 loops are allowed
	* Storing numbers in variable is not allowed
	* No importation of module is allowed9


#### 7. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

	* Prototype: *def islower(c):*
	* Returns *True* if *c* is lowercase
	* Returns *False* if otherwise
	* Importation of any module is not allowed
	* Using *str.upper()* and *str.isupper()* is not allowed


#### 8. To uppercase
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

	* Prototype: *def uppercase(str):*
	* Only use one loop
	* Returns *False* if otherwise
	* Importation of any module is not allowed
	* Using *str.upper()* and *str.isupper()* is not allowed
	* Only 2 print functions is allowed with the string format.


#### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important.

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

	* Prototype: *def print_last_digit(number):*
	* Returns The value of the last digit
	* importing any module is not allowed.


#### 10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

	* Prototype: *def add(a, b):*
	* Return: the value of *a + b*
	* importing any module is not allowed.


#### 11. a ^ b
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

	* Prototype: *def pow(a, b):*
	* Returns the value of *a ^ b*
	* importing any module is not allowed.
